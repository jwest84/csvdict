== Motivation ==

This library was first conceived as part of fire science modeling modeling project. The scientific models that were coded make use of various empirical data sets -- measurements and calculated values resulting from measurements. The data can change from time to time when new measurements or new methods of calculation are provided by scientists. CSV files seemed to be a useful means of representing the data. The scientists are themselves familiar with editing CSV files, and would not have to touch the code.

Ia the course of designing an object model for these models, a common pattern emerged of accessing a record (row) in a csv file based on the value of a certain field (column) in that file. There are various open-source java CSV libraries available, but none that facilitate this pattern, thus CSVDict was created.

Some of the CSV files have many columns. It is exceedingly tedious to count columns in order to access the desired cell. Also, to increase code readability there would have to be a proliferation of constants to represent the column numbers of fileds in the CSV files. Thus the idea of a code generator driven by a simple properties file, that could create java classes that used the CSV column header values as member data variable names was born.
